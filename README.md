# MachineLearningPracticePrograms
This repository contains programs that are often used in machine learning problems implemented with minimal dependencies. 
Requirements are python 3.5.3 (or above), numpy, matplotlib(for graphical display).

In this repo we try to implement general machine learning algorithms and calculations for learning purpose. The modules implemented are described below.

### svm ###
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. The calculations performed are based on this [link](https://github.com/MaviccPRP/svm/blob/master/svm-primal.ipynb).
